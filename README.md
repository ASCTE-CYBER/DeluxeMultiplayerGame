# Multiplayer Game
 A basic shooting game (BLASTR!) with multiplayer using sockets, made with python and pygame.

### To play:
Run the server, once instantiated run a client, connect to the IP shown on the server.

### Note:
Coming back to this project after several years, it is clear there is much to improve - the server often hangs, there are some graphical issues, and there are many syncing issues between the clients which come from a strategy of reducing communication to a minimum that was implemented when first developed.

### Demo:
(Starting the server):
